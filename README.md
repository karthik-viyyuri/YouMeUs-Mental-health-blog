# YouMeUs.in - An Interactive Mental Health Awareness Blog

## 🌱 Why I Built This
Mental health is a topic that's incredibly important but often stigmatized. I wanted to use my technical skills to build something that could make a small difference.  
My goal was to create an **accessible, user-friendly platform** where people could share their stories and find comfort in knowing they aren't alone.  

This project was also a journey into full-stack development, allowing me to manage everything from the **user interface** to the **back-end database**.
